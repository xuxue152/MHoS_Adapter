## Environment Setup

```
conda create -n fusion python=3.10
conda activate fusion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

For downloading the Kinetics datasets, you can refer to [mmaction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/master/tools/data/kinetics/README.md) or [CVDF](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset). For [UCF-101](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) and [HMDB-51](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/), you can easily get them from the official website.

Due to limited storage, we decord the videos in an online fashion using [decord](https://github.com/dmlc/decord).

We provide the following two ways to organize the dataset:

- **Option \#1:** Standard Folder. For standard folder, put all videos in the `videos` folder, and prepare the annotation files as `train.txt` and `val.txt`. Please make sure the folder looks like this:
    ```Shell
    $ ls /PATH/TO/videos | head -n 2
    a.mp4
    b.mp4

    $ head -n 2 /PATH/TO/train.txt
    a.mp4 0
    b.mp4 2

    $ head -n 2 /PATH/TO/val.txt
    c.mp4 1
    d.mp4 2
    ```


-  **Option \#2:** Zip/Tar File. When reading videos from massive small files, we recommend using zipped files to boost loading speed. The videos can be organized into a `tar` file `videos.tar`, which looks like:
    ```Shell
    $ tar -tvf /PATH/TO/videos.tar | head -n 2
    a.mp4
    b.mp4
    ```
    The `train.txt` and `val.txt` are prepared in the same way as option \#1.

Since that our method employs semantic information in text labels, rather than traditional one-hot label, it is necessary to provide a textual description for each video category. For example, we provide the text description of Kinetics-400 in the file `labels/kinetics_400_labels.csv`. Here is the format:
```Shell
$ head -n 5 labels/kinetics_400_labels.csv
id,name
0,abseiling
1,air drumming
2,answering questions
3,applauding
```
The `id` indicates the class id, while the `name` denotes the text description.

## Model Zoo

For evaluation, we provide the checkpoints of our models in the following tables.  
Our proposed **MBGF** module consistently improves CLIP-based backbones across different datasets and training settings.

### Fully-supervised on Kinetics-400

| Model | FLOPs(G) | Input | Top-1 Acc.(%) |
|--|--|--|--|
| CLIP-B/32 | 34 | 8×224 | 78.2 |
| CLIP-B/32+MBGF | 36 | 8×224 | **79.2 (+1.0)** |
| CLIP-B/32 | 72 | 16×224 | 80.1 |
| CLIP-B/32+MBGF | 72 | 16×224 | **80.1 (↔)** |
| CLIP-B/16 | 139 | 8×224 | 82.2 |
| CLIP-B/16+MBGF | 142 | 8×224 | **82.9 (+0.7)** |
| ActionCLIP-B/16 | 563 | 32×224 | 83.8 |
| ActionCLIP-B/16+MBGF | 145 | 8×224 | **83.8 (↔ with 4× less FLOPs)** |

MBGF improves CLIP-B/16 and CLIP-B/32, while enabling ActionCLIP to achieve the same accuracy with much lower computational cost.

### Transfer to UCF101 and HMDB51

| Model | Frame | UCF101 | HMDB51 |
|--|--|--|--|
| CLIP-B/16 | 8 | 96.5 | 68.9 |
| CLIP-B/16+MBGF | 8 | **97.5 (+1.0)** | **74.4 (+5.5)** |
| ActionCLIP-B/16 | 32 | 97.1 | **76.2** |
| ActionCLIP-B/16+MBGF | 8 | **97.5 (+0.4)** | 73.6 (↓ -2.6) |
| X-CLIP-B/16 | 8 | 97.4 | 75.6 |

On UCF101, MBGF consistently improves both CLIP and ActionCLIP.  
On HMDB51, MBGF provides +5.5% gain for CLIP-B/16.

### Few-shot on HMDB51

| Model | Frame | Q=2 | Q=4 | Q=8 | Q=16 |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CLIP-B/16 | 8 | 46.3 | 52.9 | 57.6 | 62.4 |
| CLIP-B/16+MBGF | 8 | **48.7 (+2.4)** | **53.6 (+0.7)** | **60.0 (+2.4)** | **65.0 (+2.6)** |
| ActionCLIP-B/16 | 8 | 43.7 | 51.2 | 55.6 | 64.2 |
| ActionCLIP-B/16+MBGF | 8 | 43.5 (↔) | 49.3 (↓ -1.9) | 56.2 (+0.6) | 62.4 (↓ -1.8) |
| X-CLIP-B/16 | 32 | **53.0** | **57.3** | **62.8** | 64.0 |

MBGF brings consistent boosts for CLIP-B/16 across all shots, especially Q=16 (+2.6%).

### Few-shot on UCF101

| Model | Frame | Q=2 | Q=4 | Q=8 | Q=16 |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| CLIP-B/16 | 8 | 73.5 | 78.6 | 83.5 | 88.4 |
| CLIP-B/16+MBGF | 8 | **78.0 (+4.5)** | **82.7 (+4.1)** | **87.4 (+3.9)** | **91.8 (+3.4)** |
| ActionCLIP-B/16 | 8 | 73.7 | 80.2 | 86.3 | 89.8 |
| ActionCLIP-B/16+MBGF | 8 | 73.7 (↔) | 80.7 (+0.5) | **87.2 (+0.9)** | **92.0 (+2.2)** |
| X-CLIP-B/16 | 32 | **76.4** | **83.4** | **88.3** | 91.4 |

On UCF101 few-shot, MBGF provides large improvements for CLIP-B/16 (+3–5%), and enhances ActionCLIP in higher-shot settings.

**Summary**  
- CLIP-B/16 + MBGF achieves consistent performance gains across Kinetics-400, UCF101, and HMDB51, especially in few-shot scenarios.  
- ActionCLIP-B/16 + MBGF reduces FLOPs dramatically on Kinetics-400 while preserving accuracy.  
- MBGF is lightweight, general, and effective across supervised and transfer learning benchmarks.
