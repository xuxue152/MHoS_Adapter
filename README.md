# MHoS-Adapter: Multimodal Higher-Order Statistical Adapter For Video Action Recognition

## Overview
<img src="MHoS.pdf" alt="MHoS-Adapter Architecture" width="600" height="500">

This is the official PyTorch implementation of **MHoS-Adapter**, a novel parameter-efficient framework for adapting CLIP to video action recognition. Our method introduces higher-order statistical modeling to capture fine-grained discriminative features that are crucial for distinguishing visually similar actions.

## Environment Setup

```
conda create -n fusion python=3.10
conda activate fusion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation

For downloading the Kinetics datasets, you can refer to [mmaction2](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmaction2/blob/master/tools/data/kinetics/README.md) or [CVDF](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset). For [UCF-101](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php) and [HMDB-51](https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/), you can easily get them from the official website.

Due to limited storage, we decord the videos in an online fashion using [decord](https://github.com/dmlc/decord).

We provide the following two ways to organize the dataset:

- **Option \#1:** Standard Folder. For standard folder, put all videos in the `videos` folder, and prepare the annotation files as `train.txt` and `val.txt`. Please make sure the folder looks like this:
    ```Shell
    $ ls /PATH/TO/videos | head -n 2
    a.mp4
    b.mp4

    $ head -n 2 /PATH/TO/train.txt
    a.mp4 0
    b.mp4 2

    $ head -n 2 /PATH/TO/val.txt
    c.mp4 1
    d.mp4 2
    ```


-  **Option \#2:** Zip/Tar File. When reading videos from massive small files, we recommend using zipped files to boost loading speed. The videos can be organized into a `tar` file `videos.tar`, which looks like:
    ```Shell
    $ tar -tvf /PATH/TO/videos.tar | head -n 2
    a.mp4
    b.mp4
    ```
    The `train.txt` and `val.txt` are prepared in the same way as option \#1.

Since that our method employs semantic information in text labels, rather than traditional one-hot label, it is necessary to provide a textual description for each video category. For example, we provide the text description of Kinetics-400 in the file `labels/kinetics_400_labels.csv`. Here is the format:
```Shell
$ head -n 5 labels/kinetics_400_labels.csv
id,name
0,abseiling
1,air drumming
2,answering questions
3,applauding
```
The `id` indicates the class id, while the `name` denotes the text description.

## Model Zoo

For evaluation, we provide the checkpoints of our models in the following tables.  
Our proposed **MHoS-Adapter** consistently improves CLIP-based backbones across different datasets and training settings with parameter-efficient fine-tuning.
